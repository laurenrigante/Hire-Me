# Hire-Me Setup

## Setup Instructions

To get the app running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project**

    Begin by cloning the 'Hire-Me' project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/laurenrigante/Hire-Me.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Switch to the project directory in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd Hire-Me
    ```

3. **Access the 'hire-me' Directory**

    Within the project directory, navigate to the 'hire-me' folder:

    ```bash
    cd hire-me
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the project dependencies, including `react-scripts`. The `--force` flag is used to avoid dependency conflicts:

    ```bash
    npm install react-scripts --force
    ```

5. **Launch the Application**

    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will automatically open the app in your default web browser.
